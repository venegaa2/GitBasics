Frame-relay configuration, point-to-point:
Create a subinterface on actual interface, than assign the dlci to interface

frame-relay configuration, multipoint-to-point:
(all routers are in the same subnet)
on subinterface of actual interface:
encap frame-relay
assign ip in same subnet as the other routers' Serial IPs
use frame-relay map to map the other routers' Serial IPs with broadcast as a parameter


Hierachial designs!

OSPF:
DRs are the distribution/collection point for LSAs
BDRs are the backups for the DRs
highest RID(manual RID/highest Loopback/IP Interface)/priority is the DR
NON-BDRs/DRs are DROTHERs 
edge routers are ASBRs, they can import OSPF info to non-OSPF networks
these elections are not in point-to-point networks, only in multiaccess networks with switches connecting the routers
configure MD5 authentication (message-digest-key) (area _ authentication _ )

ABRs have interfaces going to multiple areas, manual route summarization
ASBRs, manual route summarization

backbone routers have all interfaces in area 0

LSA 1: Router LSA
LSA 2: Network LSA
LSA 3 - 4: Summary LSA
LSA 5: AS External LSA
(basic multiarea config needs 1-5)
LSA 6: Multicast OSPF LSA
LSA 7: NSSA

EIGRP
use passive-interface on LAN interfaces, interfaces where other routers aren't going to be connected to

inevitable, anberlin
runaway love, diamond rings
someday, the growlers
